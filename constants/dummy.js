This will hopefully be the seventh book in the Remembering Wildlife series which was created by British wildlife photographer Margot Raggett after she was moved to take action upon seeing a poached elephant in Kenya. We are seeking funding via Kickstarter to make the production of the book possible. For the first time, this year the book will be 160 pages long, an increase of 16 pages on previous books but the price will remain the same.",
